# Changelog

All notable changes to Tandem Browser will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

## [v1.8.0] - 2026-05-04

Windows support Phase 10. Tandem now routes native speech transcription through
the platform voice adapter, preserving macOS Apple Speech behavior and adding a
Windows fallback that uses user-installed Whisper when `whisper.exe` is
available on `PATH`.

### Added

- **Windows voice adapter** (`src/platform/voice/`) - detects `whisper.exe`
  through Windows-style `PATH` lookup and returns a clear user-facing status
  when Whisper is not installed.
- **Voice adapter coverage** (`src/platform/tests/platform.test.ts`) - added
  regression coverage for the macOS Apple Speech backend, Windows Whisper
  lookup, and the missing-Whisper error path.

### Changed

- **Speech transcription pipeline** (`src/voice/speech-transcriber.ts`) - moved
  backend selection out of the shared transcriber and into platform adapters.
- **IPC speech handlers** (`src/ipc/handlers.ts`) - now call the selected
  platform voice adapter for backend status and transcription.
- **Platform support matrix** (`docs/platform-support.md`) - marks Windows voice
  transcription as partial for source runs with user-installed Whisper.

### Technical Details

- macOS still prefers the bundled or development `tandem-speech` Apple Speech
  binary and keeps the existing Whisper fallback when Apple Speech is missing.
- Windows support intentionally does not download models, bundle Whisper, or add
  Windows audio capture code.
- No new dependency was added.

## [v1.7.0] - 2026-05-04

Windows support Phase 9. Tandem now detects Chrome native messaging hosts on
Windows through read-only registry lookup while keeping the existing filesystem
fallback and preserving macOS/Linux directory scanning behavior.

### Added

- **Windows native messaging registry detection** (`src/platform/native-messaging/`) -
  reads Chrome native messaging host manifest paths from
  `HKCU\Software\Google\Chrome\NativeMessagingHosts` and
  `HKLM\Software\Google\Chrome\NativeMessagingHosts`.
- **Native messaging adapter coverage** (`src/extensions/tests/extensions.test.ts`) -
  added mocked Windows registry coverage and pinned the macOS native messaging
  directory list.

### Changed

- **Native messaging setup** (`src/extensions/native-messaging.ts`) - moved
  manifest discovery onto the platform adapter while retaining shared host
  validation, status reporting, and extension access checks.
- **Extension manager** (`src/extensions/manager.ts`) - creates native messaging
  setup through the selected platform adapter.
- **Platform support matrix** (`docs/platform-support.md`) - marks Windows native
  messaging host detection as supported for source runs.

### Technical Details

- Windows registry access is read-only and uses a zero-dependency PowerShell
  query from Node.
- Windows detection combines HKCU/HKLM registry manifests with the existing
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\NativeMessagingHosts` filesystem
  fallback.
- macOS native messaging directories remain unchanged.
- No new dependency was added.

## [v1.6.0] - 2026-05-04

Windows support Phase 8. Tandem now resolves Chrome profile paths through the
chrome-import platform adapter, so Windows source runs can scan Chrome profiles
under LOCALAPPDATA and import bookmarks plus history while the macOS Chrome
import path remains unchanged.

### Added

- **Windows Chrome import adapter** (`src/platform/chrome-import/`) - added
  Windows Chrome profile detection under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\<Profile>\`.
- **Chrome import fixture coverage** (`src/platform/tests/platform.test.ts`) -
  added regression tests for the macOS profile path, macOS bookmark import
  through the adapter, Windows profile listing, Windows bookmark/history import,
  and Windows cookie status.

### Changed

- **Browser data Chrome importer** (`src/import/chrome-importer.ts`) - moved
  Chrome profile path resolution onto the platform adapter and kept bookmark,
  history, sync, and status checks using adapter-resolved profile data paths.
- **Chrome extension importer** (`src/extensions/chrome-importer.ts`) - reuses
  the chrome-import platform adapter for Chrome extension profile paths.
- **Runtime bootstrap** (`src/bootstrap/runtime.ts`) - creates the Chrome
  importer through the selected platform adapter.
- **Platform support matrix** (`docs/platform-support.md`) - marks Windows
  Chrome bookmark/history import as supported and documents Windows encrypted
  cookie import as unsupported.

### Technical Details

- macOS still resolves Chrome profiles under
  `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/<Profile>`.
- Windows resolves Chrome profiles under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\<Profile>`.
- Windows encrypted Chrome cookie import remains unsupported because DPAPI
  support would require native integration or an extra dependency; CDP and
  pre-exported JSON fallback paths remain available.
- No new dependency was added.

## [v1.5.0] - 2026-05-04

Windows support Phase 7. Tandem now builds stealth UA and UA-CH values through
the platform adapter so Windows source runs present Chrome on Windows while the
macOS Chrome-on-macOS fingerprint remains pinned.

### Added

- **Windows stealth UA adapter** (`src/platform/stealth-ua/`) - added a
  Chrome-on-Windows UA profile with Windows UA-CH platform, platform-version,
  architecture, bitness, and full-version brand values.
- **Stealth UA snapshots** (`src/stealth/tests/manager.test.ts`) - pinned the
  macOS UA and UA-CH profile and added Windows profile coverage.

### Changed

- **Stealth manager UA construction** (`src/stealth/manager.ts`) - moved
  session user-agent, request UA-CH headers, and injected
  `navigator.userAgentData` values onto the platform stealth-ua adapter.
- **Windows platform selection** (`src/platform/index.ts`) - wires the Windows
  stealth UA adapter for `win32` platform runs.

### Technical Details

- macOS keeps the existing UA string, low/high-entropy UA-CH values, and
  request header behavior, including no `sec-ch-ua-platform-version` header.
- Windows emits `Sec-CH-UA-Platform: "Windows"` and
  `Sec-CH-UA-Platform-Version: "15.0.0"` for a Windows 11-compatible Chrome
  profile.
- No canvas, WebGL, audio, font-noise, or humanized input timing logic changed.

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-05-04

Windows support Phase 6. Tandem now uses adapter-driven window chrome options
and gives Windows source runs a frameless browser window with shell-owned
minimize, maximize/restore, and close controls.

### Added

- **Windows window chrome adapter** (`src/platform/window-chrome/`) - added a
  Windows BrowserWindow option path returning `frame: false` for custom
  shell-owned titlebar controls.
- **Windows platform body class** (`shell/js/window-chrome.js`) - adds
  `platform-win` on Windows while preserving the existing platform class.

### Changed

- **BrowserWindow option selection** (`src/main.ts`) - moved platform-specific
  window chrome branching into the platform adapter.
- **Shell chrome CSS** (`shell/css/browser-shell.css`) - targets Windows
  titlebar padding and controls through `platform-win`, while keeping existing
  macOS hidden inset titlebar selectors intact.

### Technical Details

- macOS BrowserWindow options remain hidden inset titlebar, traffic-light
  position, under-window vibrancy, active visual effect state, and transparent
  background.
- Linux remains frameless through the same adapter pattern used by Windows.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-05-04

Windows support Phase 5. Tandem now has a safeStorage-backed secret-store
adapter for Electron-owned secrets, while preserving the readable local
`api-token` bootstrap file for MCP and HTTP clients.

### Added

- **Secret store adapter** (`src/security/secret-store/`) - added a small
  filesystem-backed store with `get`, `set`, and `delete` operations using
  Electron `safeStorage` for encrypted records.
- **Plaintext initialization fallback** - when `safeStorage` is unavailable
  during early initialization, the adapter can write an explicit
  `plaintext-fallback-on-init` record instead of silently failing.
- **Secret store tests** - added coverage for encrypted records, plaintext
  fallback records, deletion, and key validation.

### Changed

- **Google Photos OAuth auth state** - migrated the Electron-owned
  `google-photos-auth` secret to the new secret store, with legacy plaintext
  readback and encrypted cleanup for existing installs.

### Technical Details

- Uses Electron `safeStorage.encryptString` and `safeStorage.decryptString`;
  no `keytar` or new dependency was added.
- `~/.tandem/api-token` remains plaintext and readable for local MCP/HTTP
  bootstrap compatibility.

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-05-04

Windows support Phase 4. Tandem's shared user-data helper now resolves through
the platform adapter while preserving macOS and Linux legacy storage paths.

### Added

- **Windows user-data path adapter** - `tandemDir()` now delegates through
  `src/platform/paths/`, keeping macOS/Linux on `~/.tandem` and resolving
  Windows data under `%APPDATA%\Tandem Browser`.
- **Path adapter tests** - added coverage proving the macOS legacy
  `~/.tandem/api-token` path stays unchanged and Windows resolves through
  `APPDATA/Tandem Browser`.

### Changed

- **CI verification matrix** - `npm run verify` now runs on Ubuntu, macOS, and
  Windows in GitHub Actions, with fail-fast disabled, Linux-only coverage
  upload, and only macOS blocking while Linux remains secondary and Windows is
  still being built out.
- **Startup scripts** - replaced the Unix-only `npm start` shell preflight with
  a Node launcher that compiles, clears stale local API port listeners per
  platform, preserves the macOS Electron quarantine cleanup, and starts Electron
  without changing the public platform support status.
- **Local API token hints** - API and MCP code now use the platform data helper
  for `api-token` lookups and messages, so macOS keeps `~/.tandem/api-token`
  while Windows points local agents at the APPDATA-backed directory.

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-05-04

Windows support foundation. This release adds the platform adapter layer that
later Windows phases will migrate into, while keeping current production call
sites unchanged.

### Added

- **Platform adapter foundation** - added the typed `src/platform/` layer with
  capability profiles, platform selection, Darwin wrappers, and Windows/Linux
  stubs for future phased platform work without migrating production call sites.

### Documentation

- **Windows support guardrails** - added the public platform support matrix,
  cross-platform contributor rules, PR platform-impact checks, and agent-facing
  guidance for phased Windows work without changing runtime behavior.

### Testing

- **Windows local verification** - made the consistency checker shell-free and
  updated path-sensitive tests so `npm run verify` passes on Windows.

## [v1.0.1] - 2026-04-21

Cloudflare human mode — phase 3. Challenge-sensitive tabs now run with reduced security instrumentation so Turnstile and the Cloudflare interstitial see a stock Chromium surface, while non-Cloudflare tabs keep the full security stack. Phases 4 (human handoff) and 5 (conservative resume after `cf_clearance`) are on hold.

### Added

- **`CloudflarePolicyManager`** — new tab/origin-scoped policy store that classifies tabs as challenge-sensitive based on URL, response headers (`cf_clearance`), DOM selectors, and interstitial title snippets. Exposes a `getStealthDispositionForUrl` decision function (`full` | `early` | `skip`) for the stealth preload.
- **Shared Cloudflare utilities** (`src/utils/cloudflare.ts`) — challenge-host/path detection, no-touch partition prefix helpers, and the canonical list of challenge DOM selectors reused by `HeadlessManager` and the main-process probe.
- **Early stealth script variant** — minimal navigator/UA patches without canvas, audio, or timing noise. Injected into cross-origin Turnstile iframes so stealth fingerprint perturbation no longer trips Cloudflare's challenge.

### Changed

- **Security gating on challenge-sensitive tabs** — `SecurityManager` now refuses to attach ScriptGuard main-world monitors and blocks `BehaviorMonitor` resource polling on tabs the policy manager flags as challenge-sensitive. Live policy flips trigger an immediate de-escalation on the affected tab. Normal non-Cloudflare tabs keep the existing instrumentation path.
- **Stealth preload is mode-aware** — the per-frame preload now performs a synchronous IPC (`tandem:cloudflare-policy-sync`) to the main process before injecting, and chooses between `early` (Turnstile OOPIFs) and `full` (everything else) based on the returned disposition. Google auth and `file://` frames are still skipped entirely.
- **DevTools attach logs include the `webContents` id** — every CDP attach, security-domain enable, and already-attached message now carries `wc <id>`, which makes diagnosing OOPIF-specific Cloudflare attach races possible from logs alone.

### Fixed

- **Stealth crash inside Cloudflare Turnstile OOPIFs** — the full stealth script is no longer injected into `challenges.cloudflare.com` sub-frames; those frames now receive only the early variant, which resolves the V8 crash observed during Turnstile challenges.

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-04-20

First binary release of Tandem Browser — signed and notarized for macOS Apple Silicon. This release also brings full Cloudflare/Turnstile stealth compatibility, agent trust tiers that reduce approval friction for legitimate agent work, and a raft of shell, SEO, and documentation improvements.

Seventeen merged PRs since v0.75.0. Grouped below by area.

### First binary release

- **Signed + notarized macOS binary (Apple Silicon)** — `tandem-browser-1.0.0-arm64.dmg` and `.zip` are signed with `Developer ID Application: Robin Waslander (WFQNG992GW)` and notarized by Apple. Gatekeeper accepts the app on any Apple Silicon Mac without any override needed.

### Security

- **Agent trust tiers T2/T3/T4** — agents can now earn reduced approval friction by operating within documented scope. T2 (domain-scoped), T3 (session-scoped), and T4 (fully trusted local agents) each bypass a progressively larger set of approval gates. Approval is still required for security-weakening actions at all tiers. ([#179](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/179))
- **ReDoS fix in `agentIdFromRequest`** — replaced unbounded regex with a safe character-class match. Closes a theoretical CPU exhaustion vector on malformed `Authorization` headers. ([#179](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/179))

### Stealth — Cloudflare compatibility

- **Google Chrome brand injected into `sec-ch-ua`** — Electron exposes `Chromium` in client-hint headers; Cloudflare Turnstile treats this as non-Chrome and triggers extra challenges. StealthManager now rewrites `sec-ch-ua` and `sec-ch-ua-full-version-list` to include the real `Google Chrome` brand at the correct version. ([#180](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/180))
- **GREASE brand mismatch fixed** — the GREASE token in `sec-ch-ua` was hardcoded; it now matches the token Chromium generates at runtime. ([#180](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/180))
- **`Accept-Language` casing normalised** — Electron sends lowercase `accept-language`; rewritten to `Accept-Language` to match Chrome wire format. ([#180](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/180))
- **CDP OOPIF stealth injection** — cross-origin subframes (e.g. Cloudflare's Turnstile iframe) run in separate renderer processes and never received the session preload. `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` via CDP now registers a minimal early script in every frame before any JS runs, including OOPIFs, without triggering the GPU readback crash inside sandboxed renderers. ([#180](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/180))
- **`__tandem*` globals moved to CDP isolated worlds** — internal globals no longer leak into the page's JS context where sites could detect them. ([#175](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/175))

### MCP

- **Prompt-injection trust-contract restored on content tools** — `read_page`, `extract_content`, and related tools re-gained their injection-warning contract after it was accidentally dropped in a refactor. `tabId` added to `execute_js` so background-tab JS execution is explicit and auditable. ([#174](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/174))

### Shell / UX

- **Tab `.active` class cleared on workspace switch** — a stale active-class on tabs from a previous workspace caused visual ghost-selection after switching. Added a defensive DOM sweep at switch time. ([#177](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/177))
- **Empty workspace opens a fresh new-tab** — closing all tabs in a workspace previously left focus dangling; now a clean new-tab page opens automatically. ([#178](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/178))

### Documentation & SEO

- **Website and README repositioned around what Tandem unlocks** — lead copy now centres the human+AI symbiosis angle and model-agnosticism rather than feature lists. ([#172](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/172), [#173](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/173))
- **SKILL.md rewritten** — passive orientation, workspace scoping, SPA-state mining, and updated injection-warning contract documented for agent authors. ([#176](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/176))
- **FAQ, JSON-LD, OpenGraph, sitemap, robots.txt, llms.txt** — full SEO pass: FAQPage structured data, Twitter Card and OG metadata, AI-crawler allowlist, changelog page, `/vs/` comparison pages.
- **OpenClaw origin story** — Tandem's origin as the browser built for OpenClaw is now surfaced across the site, FAQ, and llms.txt.

## [v0.75.0] - 2026-04-18

Large release driven by an external security audit (#34) by **[@samantha-gb](https://github.com/samantha-gb)** and follow-up work that surfaced while implementing her findings. Five High-tier security fixes plus CORS and agent-initiated override hardening landed alongside a proper per-user behavioural learning pipeline and audio/visual escalation for agent-blocked approvals.

Twelve merged PRs. Grouped below by area.

### Security — audit #34 findings addressed

- **Scheme + private-IP guard on `/navigate` and `/headless/open` (High-2)** — new `isSafeNavigationUrl()` helper rejects non-http(s) schemes (file://, javascript:, data:, …) and RFC1918 / link-local / cloud-metadata IP literals, including IPv6 edge cases. ([#159](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/159))
- **Form-memory files hardened to `0o600` (High-5)** — `{ mode: 0o600 }` on `~/.tandem/config.json` and `~/.tandem/forms/*.json`, with a `chmodSync` migration step that tightens pre-existing loose files on next boot. ([#159](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/159))
- **Per-install random stealth seed (Low/stealth)** — replaced the deterministic `sha256('persist:tandem')` seed with a per-install random secret persisted in `~/.tandem/config.json`. Every install now produces a unique fingerprint-noise pattern; previously every install shared the same signature. ([#159](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/159))
- **Security-weakening endpoints behind user approval (High-1)** — `POST /security/guardian/mode`, `POST /security/domains/:domain/trust`, and `POST /security/outbound/whitelist` now require interactive user approval via `taskManager.requestApproval` when the change would weaken posture. Tightening and no-op changes still pass through without friction. ([#161](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/161))
- **Unused `EXECUTE_JS` IPC channel removed (High-4)** — the channel had zero callers but would have amplified any XSS reaching the shell into arbitrary JS in the active tab. Agent-driven JS execution continues to flow through the scanner-protected HTTP routes. ([#162](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/162))
- **CRX3 RSA signature verification on extension install (High-3)** — hand-rolled protobuf decoder parses the CRX3 envelope, verifies the SHA-256-with-RSA signature, and binds the signing key back to the expected extension ID. CRX2 downloads are rejected outright. Defends against MITM or CDN compromise during CWS downloads. ([#163](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/163))
- **Agent-initiated `/security/injection-override` behind user approval (Medium #3)** — silencing the prompt-injection scanner now requires either the user clicking "Override" in the scanner modal (existing flow, unchanged) or an interactive approval prompt for any other caller. Prevents a prompt-injected agent from disabling the defence against its own compromise. ([#164](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/164), corrected in [#165](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/165))
- **CORS `Origin: null` rejected on public routes (Medium #1)** — closes a cross-tab information leak where a sandboxed iframe or `data:` URI could fetch `/status` from localhost and read the active tab's URL/title. Shell-fetches pass through because modern Electron strips the Origin header (verified via logging investigation). ([#165](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/165))
- **Date.now jitter removed from the stealth script (Low #4)** — the ±1 ms jitter was itself a reliable "not real Chrome" fingerprint (real Chrome returns the same ms for back-to-back calls). `performance.now` rounding to 100 μs (Firefox parity) remains as the effective timing-fingerprint defence. Also fixed a BehaviorObserver bug that persisted `interval: 0` on every keypress event, and removed the unwired `recordClick` method. ([#168](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/168))

### Wingman UX

- **Wingman Activity and Chat panels now sync on approval resolution** — clicking Approve/Reject in one panel dismisses the matching card in the other. The underlying `approval-response` event is now forwarded to the shell via a new IPC channel mirroring `APPROVAL_REQUEST`. ([#166](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/166))
- **Audio ping + escalation + user-return re-alert on approval requests** — when an agent stalls waiting for human input, the user now gets: (a) an immediate native-OS notification with the system sound; (b) a second ping after 12 s if the request is still unacknowledged; (c) a third ping when the user returns to Tandem after being away for more than 10 s. A 5 s rate limit prevents stacking. Exists because "AI is stalled on a call" is an invisible state today if the user happens to be in a different workspace or away. ([#167](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/167))

### Agent-learn layer — phase 1

- **BehaviorCompiler is real now, not a stub** — reads `~/.tandem/behavior/raw/*.jsonl`, extracts valid keypress intervals, drops outliers (below 30 ms / above 2000 ms), percentile-trims 5%, and computes a per-user `meanWpm` / `variance`. Fallback to hardcoded defaults below a 100-sample floor or outside a `[20, 150]` WPM sane range. `BehavioralProfile` gained additive observability fields: `source` (default / default-insufficient / compiled), `samples`, `lastCompiledAt`. Compiled at every Tandem boot; new `POST /behavior/recompile` endpoint forces a fresh compile on demand. Was previously a comment saying "in a real scenario we would parse the data; for now we compile defaults" — so every install's agent typed at the same average-typist rhythm. ([#169](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/169))
- **Webview keystroke rhythm capture (intervals only, no content)** — a `before-input-event` listener inside the existing `web-contents-created` handler captures typing rhythm from tab content, feeding the same JSONL stream the shell observer already populates. PRIVACY FLOOR: only `input.type` and `input.key.length` are read; the key value itself, the webContents URL, origin, partition, and tabId are never read. Persisted events contain only `{type, ts, data: {interval}}`. A regression-guard test inspects every persisted event and fails red if anything else appears. ([#170](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/170))

### Documentation

- **[@samantha-gb](https://github.com/samantha-gb) acknowledged in SECURITY.md and on the contributor graph via `Co-authored-by:` trailers.** Her security audit drove nine of the twelve PRs in this release. ([#160](https://github.com/hydro13/tandem-browser/pull/160))
- **SECURITY.md restructured** with explicit "anonymous / pseudonymous reports welcome" copy, a "no bounty, yes gratitude" section describing what contributors can expect in exchange for a responsible report, and a new Hall of Fame.

### Internal notes

- **Threat model clarified for future security reviews.** Tandem's trust perimeter sits between web content and the team (user + paired local/remote agents), not between team members. Findings that describe authenticated callers receiving internal tokens or state are, under this model, not vulnerabilities. Several items from the #34 audit were re-evaluated and intentionally not changed on that basis; the reasoning is documented inline in the relevant PR comments and in `SECURITY.md`.
- **Cross-panel sync bug surfaced and fixed while testing the injection-override approval flow.** The audio/escalation UX work was added after live-testing revealed that agent stalls could go unnoticed when the user was in a different workspace.

## [v0.74.0] - 2026-04-17

- refactor: split the renderer shell into ES modules + fix a long-standing workspace assignment race

### Changed

- The renderer shell (`shell/js/sidebar/index.js` and `shell/js/wingman/index.js`) has been migrated from a single classic script per panel to ES modules with one file per responsibility. The monolithic sidebar file shrank from ~1700 LOC to ~250 LOC of wiring; panel logic now lives in focused `shell/js/sidebar/panels/*.js` and `shell/js/wingman/*.js` modules with explicit imports. Classic-script consumers still reach the shell via the existing `window.*` bridge so nothing outside the shell needed to change.
- Sidebar state (`config.js`, `constants.js`), drag-and-drop, panel-resize, setup flow, webview lifecycle, history, bookmarks, pinboard, workspaces, and tab-context-menu are now each their own module with a narrow public surface. Wingman alerts, screenshot capture, panel shell, chat, and chat-streaming received the same treatment.
- A renderer-side bookmarks store (`shell/js/bookmarks-store.js`) is now the single source of truth for the top bar and sidebar panel, so a bookmark added from the sidebar no longer waits for the next HTTP poll to appear in the top bar (and vice versa).
- Review-driven tightening during the refactor: unused wingman mic / live-mode toggle removed, chat API surface trimmed and `sendMessage` documented, bookmark favicon helper de-duplicated, pinboard `pbEscape` now escapes quotes for attribute contexts, pinboard mutation errors surface to the user, pinboard listeners are de-duplicated, and the pinboard panel gained an inline board-rename UI.

### Fixed

- The `+` new-tab button now assigns the new tab to the currently-active workspace instead of falling back to Default. `WorkspaceManager.reconcileTabState` previously stripped the new `webContentsId` during the window between `web-contents-created` (when main assigns the tab) and `TabManager.tabs.set` (when `openTab` finishes), after which the orphan-push block relocated the tab to Default. A new `pendingAssignments` set protects just-assigned tabs from the strip until the runtime catches up. Regression test included. The underlying race was latent since v0.69.x; the sidebar ESM migration in this release changed call timing enough to make it reliable.
- Workspace and pinboard names containing quotes or HTML no longer break the sidebar context menu or edit form — both code paths now escape for the attribute context they're inlined into.
- Opening Tips/Help from the sidebar now creates a new tab instead of replacing the active tab's contents.

## [v0.73.1] - 2026-04-16

- fix: register MCP session after transport assigns ID

The SDK's sessionIdGenerator fires during handleRequest (on the
initialize call), not during server.connect(). Move session
registration to after handleRequest so the stored session ID
matches what the client receives in the Mcp-Session-Id header.

Also rewrites http-transport tests to use real HTTP requests
against a test server for reliable SDK integration coverage.

## [v0.73.0] - 2026-04-14

- feat: expand live watch and screenshot automation surfaces

### Fixed

- `POST /wingman-alert` no longer pulls the human out of their current workspace by default, while explicit context activation remains available for the few flows that really need it
- Opening the Wingman panel with open handoffs now lands on `Activity` instead of `Chat`, so the user sees the actionable inbox immediately when responding to a handoff cue
- Standalone `waiting_approval` handoffs now resolve correctly on `Approve` and `Reject` even when they are not linked to a paused task step, so generic approval requests no longer appear to do nothing
- The Wingman handoff list now gives open cards enough vertical room for common two-item cases, removing the cramped internal scrollbar seen during live testing
- Version metadata now stays aligned across `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, repo docs, the landing page, and the MCP server, with `scripts/check-consistency.js` extended to catch future drift automatically
- Apple Photos screenshot import now passes a real file `alias` into the Photos AppleScript flow instead of a raw POSIX file URL, fixing the blank-name / "Cannot Import Item" failure seen after application captures

### Added

- Remote agent pairing over Tailscale: agents on another machine can pair with Tandem via a one-time setup code (TDM-XXXX-XXXX), receive a durable binding token, and use the full HTTP API remotely — proven with Windows 11 + VS Code + Claude Code connecting to macOS over Tailscale
- PairingManager with setup code generation (5-minute TTL), token exchange, binding lifecycle (paired/paused/revoked/removed), SHA-256 token hashing, and persistent storage at `~/.tandem/pairing/bindings.json`
- Public bootstrap/discovery routes: `GET /agent` (human-readable), `GET /agent/manifest` (machine-readable with all endpoint families), `GET /agent/version` (capability summary), `GET /skill` (version-matched usage guide) — all request-aware so URLs are correct over Tailscale
- Pairing HTTP routes: `POST /pairing/setup-code`, `POST /pairing/exchange` (public, rate-limited), `GET /pairing/whoami`, `GET /pairing/bindings`, pause/resume/revoke/remove per binding, and `GET /pairing/addresses` for Tailscale address auto-detection
- Binding token auth (`tdm_ast_` prefix) accepted alongside existing local `api-token` for all HTTP routes and the `/watch/live` WebSocket
- Onboarding-first "Connect your AI to Tandem" Settings UI with mode selector (same machine / another machine), address detection, instruction generation with `bindingKind`, and binding management cards
- API listen host defaults to `0.0.0.0` (local + remote simultaneously) with auto-migration from `127.0.0.1` for existing installs
- `ws://127.0.0.1:8765/watch/live` now streams an immediate watch snapshot plus incremental watch add/remove/check events to authenticated local clients, giving agents a real-time watch surface instead of polling `/watch/list`
- Watches now support configurable diff modes for change detection: `content`, `title`, `title-or-content`, and `text-length`, exposed through both the HTTP API and MCP watch-add flow
- New HTTP screenshot capture routes: `POST /screenshot/application` saves a fresh full-window capture, and `POST /screenshot/region` saves a fresh application-region capture without requiring renderer IPC or clipboard round-trips
- Matching MCP media tools now expose the same capture modes for MCP-first clients, bringing the server tool count to 250 while keeping screenshot capture parity with the local HTTP API

## [v0.72.1] - 2026-04-14

- fix: keep handoff attention visible when the Wingman panel is closed

### Changed

- The closed Wingman badge and panel toggle now enter a durable handoff attention state with a visible count whenever open handoffs still need action, so the UI keeps saying "the agent still needs you" after the transient popup expires
- New handoffs escalate in layers instead of replaying popup/audio loops: the existing popup + sound still fire once, while the closed-panel affordances keep a calmer persistent state and strengthen visually after roughly 12 seconds if the handoff remains unseen
- Opening the Wingman panel now acknowledges current handoffs and resets the stronger alert state, while unresolved handoffs still remain visible in a quieter pending style when the panel is closed again
- Handoff serialization and renderer IPC now include a derived `attentionLevel` (`review`, `action`, `urgent`) so UI policy can stay explicit without changing the durable handoff persistence model
- Added focused unit coverage for the new handoff attention-level mapping and extended route assertions so the extra metadata remains stable across the API surface

## [v0.72.0] - 2026-04-13

- feat: add explicit human↔agent handoffs across API, MCP, events, and Wingman UI

### Added

- Durable `HandoffManager` persistence in `~/.tandem/handoffs.json` with explicit statuses for `needs_human`, `blocked`, `waiting_approval`, `ready_to_resume`, `completed_review`, and `resolved`
- New HTTP API routes for handoff lifecycle and targeting: `GET /handoffs`, `GET /handoffs/:id`, `POST /handoffs`, `PATCH /handoffs/:id`, `POST /handoffs/:id/resolve`, and `POST /handoffs/:id/activate`
- New MCP tools for the same handoff system: `tandem_handoff_create`, `tandem_handoff_list`, `tandem_handoff_get`, `tandem_handoff_update`, and `tandem_handoff_resolve`
- New MCP resource `tandem://handoffs/open` plus SSE handoff events so open handoffs can be observed live
- A real Wingman Activity inbox for open handoffs, including workspace/tab context, action hints, open-context targeting, and resolve/mark-ready actions
- A shared `TaskHandoffCoordinator` plus explicit handoff actions for `ready`, `resume`, `approve`, and `reject`, so task-linked handoffs can now pause tasks, move into `ready-to-resume`, and hand execution back to the agent cleanly

### Changed

- `POST /wingman-alert` now acts as a compatibility wrapper over the handoff system, preserving the old alert behavior while also creating a durable `needs_human` handoff
- Task approval requests now also appear as structured handoffs instead of only transient approval cards, keeping human attention requests visible in one place
- Wingman Activity logging now records handoff lifecycle updates so the user can see when a handoff was created, updated, or resolved
- Handoff metadata normalization now treats blank titles/reasons as defaults, and focused route/MCP/manager tests cover the new handoff lifecycle more thoroughly so coverage matches the added product surface
- The Wingman Activity inbox now surfaces status-aware actions: approval handoffs show `Approve` / `Reject`, human-blocked handoffs show `Mark Ready`, and `ready_to_resume` handoffs show `Resume Agent`
- `skill/SKILL.md` now teaches agents the real runtime model more explicitly: Tandem must already be running, some clients are effectively MCP-first, durable handoffs are preferred over transient alerts for resumable blockers, interaction completion should be verified explicitly, and DevTools/network observation should stay tab-aware

## [v0.71.4] - 2026-04-13

- fix: make fill replacement and keyboard completion confirmation match observed browser state

### Fixed

- `POST /snapshot/fill` now prepares a real replacement selection on the target field before trusted key events are sent, so filling a populated input replaces the old value instead of corrupting it through caret-dependent append behavior
- Selector-based `POST /type` with `clear: true` now uses the same replacement-first strategy, preserving trusted input events while making pre-populated field replacement deterministic
- Keyboard actions (`POST /press-key`, `POST /press-key-combo`) now confirm observable active-element focus shifts even when the focused element keeps the same tag name, keeping `completion.effectConfirmed` aligned with the returned `postAction.page.activeElement`
- Label locators now fall back to a runtime DOM association pass when the CDP label search misses, improving `POST /find` by `label` on simple `label[for]` fixtures
- Added focused tests for selector replacement typing, snapshot ref fill replacement, focus-shift confirmation, and runtime label lookup fallback

## [v0.71.3] - 2026-04-13

- fix: strengthen interaction completion semantics across HTTP API and MCP

### Fixed

- Selector-based `POST /click` and `POST /type` now return explicit tab scope, target resolution, completion mode, and lightweight post-action state instead of leaving agents to infer whether the action actually landed
- Snapshot ref actions (`POST /snapshot/click`, `POST /snapshot/fill`) now distinguish dispatch completion from confirmed effect, include the resolved tab scope for the ref target, and report post-action element/page state when it can be observed cheaply
- Semantic locator routes (`POST /find`, `/find/click`, `/find/fill`, `/find/all`) now honor tab targeting, expose the resolved scope in their responses, and preserve locator resolution details when they chain into ref actions
- Keyboard actions (`POST /press-key`, `POST /press-key-combo`) now return scoped completion metadata and post-action page/navigation state instead of a bare acknowledgement
- MCP navigation and snapshot tools now describe the underlying guarantees accurately and surface the richer HTTP action contracts instead of flattening them into vague success text
- Added focused route, MCP, and confirmation-helper tests for delayed fill confirmation, post-click/navigation state, and tab-targeted interaction semantics

## [v0.71.2] - 2026-04-13

- fix: harden tab-scoped devtools and network inspection across HTTP API and MCP

### Fixed

- DevTools read routes now resolve an explicit tab target, default to the active tab, and return scope metadata so `status`, `console`, `network`, `performance`, `storage`, `evaluate`, DOM queries, and raw CDP calls no longer imply global state when they are tab-scoped
- CDP network capture now keys requests by `webContents` target instead of raw `requestId` alone, preventing cross-tab collisions and making `/devtools/network/:requestId/body` trustworthy when multiple attached tabs are active
- The webRequest-based network inspector now records tab identity and resource type, so `/network/log`, `/network/apis`, `/network/domains`, and `/network/har` can be filtered per tab instead of mixing traffic from unrelated tabs or extension noise
- MCP DevTools and network tools now describe active-tab-by-default behavior accurately, forward `tabId` only where the HTTP API truly honors it, and expose scoped status/body/summary calls that match the underlying routes
- Added focused route, MCP, DevTools capture, and network inspector tests to keep scoped-vs-global behavior aligned across the API surface

## [v0.71.1] - 2026-04-13

- fix: stabilize multi-actor workspace, tab, SSE, and MCP ownership context

### Fixed

- Active workspace selection and active tab ownership now reconcile deterministically instead of drifting apart during focus changes, workspace switches, or agent-opened tabs
- `GET /workspaces` now reports whether the active workspace comes from a focused tab or an explicit workspace selection
- `GET /active-tab/context` now includes trustworthy workspace/source/actor ownership data for the active tab and the global tab list
- `/events/stream` now attaches workspace and actor/source context to tab-driven events when known
- Workspace activation no longer forces a focus churn when the target workspace already has a live tab; empty-workspace activation remains explicit as a `selection`
- MCP tab/chat actions now use a single configurable actor source (`TANDEM_SOURCE` / `TANDEM_MCP_SOURCE` / `TANDEM_ACTOR_SOURCE`) instead of a hardcoded `wingman`/`claude` split
- MCP resources (`tandem://tabs/list`, `tandem://context`) now surface workspace/source ownership details instead of hiding them behind older global summaries

## [v0.71.0] - 2026-04-11

- feat: tab emoji badges — assign emoji to tabs for quick visual identification

New endpoints:
- POST /tabs/:id/emoji — set or flash an emoji badge on a tab
- DELETE /tabs/:id/emoji — remove emoji badge from a tab

New MCP tools:
- tandem_tab_emoji_set — set emoji badge on a tab
- tandem_tab_emoji_remove — remove emoji badge from a tab
- tandem_tab_emoji_flash — flash a pulsing emoji to attract user attention

Emoji badges are per tab session. The AI can flash emojis to signal the user
(e.g. "this tab is ready for review"). Users assign emojis via right-click
context menu. Everything runs in the shell — no injection into webviews.

## [v0.70.0] - 2026-04-10

- feat: add awareness tools — digest and focus for shared human-AI context

Two new endpoints + MCP tools:
- GET /awareness/digest — recent browser activity (navigation, interactions,
  errors, tabs, downloads, watches) for the last N minutes
- GET /awareness/focus — lightweight current-state check (active tab,
  activity type, idle time, error flags)

These enable the AI to understand what the human is doing and contribute
meaningfully — the core of the tandem principle.

## [v0.69.3] - 2026-04-10

- fix: add .nojekyll to enable static GitHub Pages

## [v0.69.2] - 2026-04-10

- fix: move FUNDING.yml to correct location (.github/)

## [v0.69.1] - 2026-04-10

- fix: route MCP server logging to stderr to prevent protocol corruption

MCP uses stdio for JSON protocol messages. console.info/debug go to stdout
and break the protocol. All MCP server logging now goes through console.error
(stderr) only.

## [v0.69.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- Chrome-style URL bar autocomplete from browsing history — dropdown with matching URLs, inline completion, keyboard navigation
- MCP bookmark management tools: `tandem_bookmarks_list`, `tandem_bookmark_add`, `tandem_bookmark_delete`, `tandem_bookmark_update`, `tandem_bookmark_folder_add`, `tandem_bookmark_move`, `tandem_bookmark_check`
- MCP history and site memory tools: `tandem_history_list`, `tandem_history_clear`, `tandem_activity_log`, `tandem_site_memory_list`, `tandem_site_memory_get`, `tandem_site_memory_search`
- MCP keyboard input tools: `tandem_press_key`, `tandem_press_key_combo` with `POST /press-key` and `POST /press-key-combo` HTTP endpoints
- MCP live preview tools: `tandem_preview_create`, `tandem_preview_update`, `tandem_preview_list`, `tandem_preview_delete`
- MCP server now exposes **231 tools** with full HTTP API parity (up from 63 in v0.68.0)
- MCP tools refactored into 29 modular files under `src/mcp/tools/` matching the HTTP API route structure
- MCP Chrome import tools: profiles, bookmarks, history, cookies, sync start/stop/status
- MCP extension extras: Chrome import, gallery, updates lifecycle, disk usage, conflicts, native messaging
- MCP sidebar tools: config, toggle/activate items, reorder, state
- MCP media tools: voice start/stop/status, audio start/stop/status/recordings, draw toggle, panel toggle
- MCP screenshot extras: annotated capture, screenshot list
- MCP events/behavior tools: recent events, live status/toggle, behavior stats/clear
- MCP system tools: folder picker, injection override, Google Photos integration
- MCP agent extras: autonomy get/update, approval check, agent activity log, per-tab lock status
- MCP password, form, workflow, task, pinboard, watch, headless, auth, context, script/style, session, device, data, preview tools — all at full parity

### Fixed

- Dark mode rendering: disabled Chromium's `WebContentsForceDark` that forcefully darkened websites without native dark mode support; set `nativeTheme.themeSource = 'system'` so sites receive OS preference naturally
- Google CookieMismatch: restored real Electron UA for Google auth URLs (session.setUserAgent baked fake Chrome UA into defaults — must overwrite, not delete); disabled cookie partitioning features that Electron can't handle without Related Website Sets; fixed Sec-CH-UA header mismatch for Google auth
- Stealth UA auto-sync: replaced hardcoded `Chrome/131` with dynamic version from `process.versions.chrome` to prevent version mismatch detection
- Workspace emoji icons: `getIconSvg()` now renders emoji strings directly instead of falling back to default SVG
- History date formatting: fixed `Invalid Date` in `tandem_history_list` (field name mismatch: `visitedAt` → `lastVisitTime`)
- URL autocomplete auth: added missing `Authorization: Bearer` header to history search API calls

## [v0.68.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- MCP server expanded from 24 to 63 tools — full API coverage for any MCP-connected agent (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenClaw, or third-party)
- MCP tab targeting: optional `tabId` parameter on all read/interaction tools for background tab operations via `X-Tab-Id`
- MCP accessibility snapshots: `tandem_snapshot`, `tandem_snapshot_click`, `tandem_snapshot_fill` with `@ref` IDs
- MCP semantic locators: `tandem_find`, `tandem_find_click`, `tandem_find_fill` for role/text/label/placeholder queries
- MCP DevTools tools: console log inspection, network monitoring, DOM queries, performance metrics, storage inspection, JS evaluation via CDP
- MCP network tools: network log, API endpoint discovery, HAR export, request mocking/unmocking
- MCP workspace tools: create, activate, delete, move tabs between workspaces
- MCP session tools: isolated session create/switch/destroy, same-origin fetch relay
- MCP tab locks: acquire/release for multi-agent coordination
- MCP content tools: structured content extraction, raw HTML, cookie management
- `tandem_wingman_alert` MCP tool for agent→human escalation with notification levels
- `tandem_scroll` now supports `target` (top/bottom) and `selector` (scroll-into-view) parameters
- `tandem_open_tab` now accepts optional `workspaceId` parameter via MCP
- esbuild bundling for preload scripts to support Electron sandbox mode with modular source files

### Fixed

- Preload module split (PR #49) broke all renderer→main IPC because `sandbox: true` only allows `require('electron')` in preload scripts; resolved by bundling with esbuild

### Security

- Updated electron 40.6.0 → 40.8.5 (17 alerts resolved)
- Updated hono → 4.12.12, @hono/node-server → 1.19.13 (6 alerts resolved)
- Updated lodash → 4.18.1 (2 alerts: code injection, prototype pollution)
- Fixed brace-expansion and path-to-regexp vulnerabilities
- Resolved all 28 Dependabot security alerts → 0 vulnerabilities

## [v0.67.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- AI workspaces for agents: OpenClaw or any API-driven agent can now operate in its own dedicated Tandem workspace, keep its tabs separate from Robin's browsing, and persist that workspace across sessions
- `POST /workspaces/:id/activate` switches the active workspace via API so Tandem can bring the agent's workspace into view instantly
- `POST /workspaces/:id/tabs` moves an existing tab into a workspace by webContents ID
- `POST /tabs/open` now accepts `inheritSessionFrom` and copies IndexedDB data from the source tab into the new tab before reloading the destination, preserving Discord-style IndexedDB-backed logins.

### Changed
- `POST /tabs/open` now accepts `workspaceId`, so new tabs can be assigned directly into the agent's workspace at creation time
- `POST /wingman-alert` now accepts optional `workspaceId`, so captcha or takeover alerts can automatically switch Tandem into the right workspace before notifying Robin

## [v0.66.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- `X-Tab-Id` header support for background-tab targeting on `GET /snapshot`, `GET /page-content`, `GET /page-html`, `POST /execute-js`, `POST /wait`, `GET /links`, and `GET /forms`
- Snapshot refs now remember which tab produced them, so ref follow-up actions stay attached to the correct tab

### Changed
- `skill/SKILL.md` now reflects the current Tandem API targeting model and includes ClawHub frontmatter metadata

### Fixed
- `/find/click` and `/find/fill` now catch thrown route errors and return JSON `500` responses instead of dropping the connection

## [v0.65.5] - 2026-03-21

- fix: CodeQL config — exclude security scanner modules from XSS taint analysis

The PromptInjectionGuard and injection-scanner middleware intentionally parse
untrusted HTML to detect prompt injection. Matched text is sanitized via
character-level escaping and only appears in JSON API responses, never in
browser DOM context. CodeQL's js/xss taint tracking cannot distinguish this
from actual XSS vulnerabilities.

## [v0.65.4] - 2026-03-21

- fix: CodeQL — use char-level sanitization to break taint tracking for HTML output

## [v0.65.3] - 2026-03-21

- fix: CodeQL — strengthen HTML/JS escaping, escape at extraction point, strip script tags

## [v0.65.2] - 2026-03-21

- fix: CodeQL — escape HTML/JS in injection scanner output to prevent XSS

## [v0.65.1] - 2026-03-21

- fix: lint — prefer-const for zeroWidthPositions

## [v0.65.0] - 2026-03-21

- feat: Prompt Injection Guard — browser-level AI content defense (Layer 8)

- New PromptInjectionGuard module with 40+ detection patterns
- Hidden text detection: CSS, HTML, Unicode tricks
- API middleware on /page-content, /page-html, /snapshot, /execute-js
- Risk scoring: ≥70 blocks content, 30-70 warns, <30 passes
- Centered modal alerts with tab highlighting (red/orange)
- Double-confirmation override with 5-min TTL per domain
- Config integrity monitor on openclaw.json
- 89 tests with false positive validation

## [v0.64.0] - 2026-03-21

### New: Prompt Injection Guard (Security Layer 8)

Tandem now detects and blocks prompt injection attacks in web page content before
it reaches the AI agent. This is the first browser-level prompt injection defense.

- **New module:** `PromptInjectionGuard` — 40+ regex patterns detecting instruction
  override, role hijacking, config manipulation, credential theft, stealth instructions,
  and filesystem write attempts
- **Hidden text detection:** CSS tricks (font-size:0, opacity:0, off-screen positioning),
  HTML tricks (comments, noscript, template, data attributes, aria-labels),
  Unicode tricks (zero-width chars, RTL override, homoglyphs)
- **API middleware:** Scans all content returned via `/page-content`, `/page-html`,
  `/snapshot`, `/snapshot/text`, and `/execute-js`
- **Risk scoring:** 0-100 scale. Score ≥70 = content BLOCKED (AI receives nothing).
  Score 30-70 = content forwarded with `injectionWarnings` field
- **User alerts:** Centered modal with detected threats, source URL, and tab highlighting
  (red for blocked, orange for warnings)
- **User override:** "Override — Allow this page" button with double confirmation
  ("Are you absolutely sure?"). Override grants 5-minute access per domain
- **Config integrity monitor:** Watches `openclaw.json` for suspicious modifications
  (CORS wildcard, short auth tokens). Triggers OS notification on tamper detection
- **89 tests** covering text patterns, CSS/HTML/Unicode tricks, combined scanning,
  and false positive validation

### Security endpoint
- `POST /security/injection-override` — User override for blocked domains (5 min TTL)

### Dialog endpoint
- `POST /dialog/pick-folder` — Native folder picker for screenshot settings

## [v0.63.6] - 2026-03-20

- fix: add zhipin.com to stealth skip list — bypasses bot detection after login

## [v0.63.5] - 2026-03-20

- fix: resolve CHANGELOG merge conflict

## [v0.63.4] - 2026-03-20

- fix: increase V8 heap limit to 4GB to prevent OOM on memory-heavy SPAs

### Linux Fixes

- **fix(linux): make OpenClaw identity loading async to prevent main process blocking**
  
  Converted synchronous `fs.readFileSync`/`writeFileSync` calls in OpenClaw identity 
  loading to async `fs.promises` API. The sync calls were blocking the main process 
  during WebSocket connect handshake, causing "not responding" dialogs on Linux 
  (macOS was unaffected due to different I/O scheduling).

- **fix(linux): add overflow scrolling to sidebar for screens with limited height**
  
  Added `overflow-y: auto` to `.sidebar-items` so sidebar icons are accessible via 
  scroll on smaller screens. Settings/Help/Collapse buttons no longer get cut off.

## [v0.63.3] - 2026-03-20

- fix: resolve CI test failures — safe app.getVersion(), update quickLinks count in tests

## [v0.63.2] - 2026-03-20

## [v0.63.1] - 2026-03-20

- fix: UI/UX polish pass v0.63.0 — 18 fixes across shell, sidebar, settings, screenshots

## [v0.63.0] - 2026-03-20

UI/UX polish pass — 18 fixes across shell, sidebar, settings, and screenshots.

### Shell & Menus
- fix: rename first app menu from "Electron" to "Tandem Browser"
- fix: remove redundant Window menu
- fix: move Draw Mode to Edit menu, remove Copilot/Wingman menu
- fix: move "About Tandem Browser" to Help menu

### Sidebar
- fix: sidebar defaults to wide mode on first launch, remembers preference thereafter
- fix: wide mode shows labels next to icons, group headers visible
- fix: tooltips only shown in narrow mode
- fix: footer buttons left-aligned with labels (Collapse, Customize, Tips & Tutorials)
- fix: Customize button now works as toggle (click to open, click again to close)
- fix: remove Downloads and Personal News from sidebar settings

### Quick Links
- fix: auto-save on add/remove/change (no more Save button, debounced 600ms)
- fix: default quick links updated to public profiles (DuckDuckGo, Google, GitHub, X, LinkedIn, YouTube)

### Wingman
- fix: display name changed from "Robin" to "You" in Wingman chat

### Help
- fix: Help/lamp button links to local help.html instead of external URL

### About
- fix: About panel now shows dynamic version from app (was hardcoded v0.57.6)

### Settings
- fix: Language, Wingman panel default open, and Show bookmarks bar marked as "Coming soon" and disabled
- fix: Screenshot storage path now uses native folder picker dialog instead of text input

### Screenshots
- fix: Apple Photos import error -1728 — more robust AppleScript, 300ms flush delay, permission check

## [v0.62.17] - 2026-03-18

- fix: update default quick links — remove personal/ClaroNote links, add Robin's public profiles

## [v0.62.16] - 2026-03-17

- fix: satisfy CodeQL rate limit detection (api)

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: src/api/routes/data.ts
- Swapped the OpenClaw token/connect route limiters to a CodeQL-recognized express-rate-limit middleware while keeping the existing request caps and messages

Why this approach:
- The endpoint was already protected by the custom limiter, but CodeQL does not treat that middleware as a proven rate limiter for this filesystem-backed handler
- Using a standard limiter on the sensitive OpenClaw config routes removes the false-positive gate without changing the user-visible behavior

Tested:
- npx tsc --pretty false: zero errors
- npx vitest run src/api/tests/routes/data.test.ts: 52 passed

## [v0.62.15] - 2026-03-17

- fix: restore stock OpenClaw Wingman chat (wingman)

What was built/changed:
- New files: src/openclaw/connect.ts
- Modified files: src/api/routes/data.ts, src/api/tests/routes/data.test.ts, src/ipc/handlers.ts, src/panel/manager.ts, src/preload.ts, shell/chat/openclaw-backend.js, shell/chat/router.js, shell/js/wingman.js, TODO.md, CHANGELOG.md
- New API endpoints: GET /config/openclaw-connect
- Chat send/persist flow now stores Robin and Wingman messages without depending on the old local tandem-chat skill

Why this approach:
- Stock Tandem now signs a real OpenClaw device identity for the gateway WebSocket handshake and uses the same operator read/write chat flow as the official OpenClaw webchat
- This removes the hidden dependency on a local /chat polling bridge and fixes the misleading connected state in the panel

Tested:
- npx tsc --pretty false: zero errors
- npx vitest run: 34 files, 1036 passed, 39 skipped
- Manual: verified local OpenClaw gateway chat round-trip in the Wingman panel, GET /config/openclaw-connect, and persisted replies via GET /chat

**Live HTML preview system — build and iterate pages directly inside Tandem**

OpenClaw can now create, update, and serve live HTML previews inside Tandem Browser. The workflow: ask your agent to build a page, it appears instantly in a new tab, you give feedback, the agent updates it, the tab refreshes automatically. No external tools, no file:// URLs, no dev servers.

### New endpoints

- `POST /preview` — create a new preview from HTML. Tandem opens it in a new tab automatically. Pass `title`, `html`, and optionally `inspiration` (source URL for reference). Returns the stable preview URL.
- `PUT /preview/:id` — update an existing preview. The tab auto-refreshes within 2 seconds via a lightweight polling script injected into the page. Version counter increments on every update.
- `GET /preview/:id` — serve the preview as a real HTTP page (not file://). Bookmarkable, shareable within the local machine, works with external fonts and CDN resources.
- `GET /preview/:id/meta` — metadata only (id, title, version, dates). Used internally by the live-reload script.
- `GET /previews` — list all saved previews as JSON.
- `GET /previews/index` — human-readable index page of all previews.
- `DELETE /preview/:id` — remove a preview.

### Storage

Previews are persisted to `~/.tandem/previews/<id>.json`. Each file contains the full HTML, title, inspiration URL, creation/update timestamps, and a version counter. Previews survive Tandem restarts. IDs are slugified from the title (`robin-portfolio`, `kanbu-landing-page`, etc.) and deduplicated automatically.

### Live reload

Every preview page gets a small injected script that polls `/preview/:id/meta` every 2 seconds. When the version number changes, the page reloads. This means the agent can iterate on a design while the human watches the result update in real time — no manual refresh needed.

### Workflow example

```
You:   "build me a portfolio page inspired by this site: https://example.com"
Agent: opens https://example.com in one tab, reads the design
Agent: generates HTML/CSS, POSTs to /preview
Tandem: opens http://127.0.0.1:8765/preview/my-portfolio in a new tab
You:   "make the header bigger and change the color to dark blue"
Agent: PUTs updated HTML to /preview/my-portfolio
Tab:   auto-refreshes within 2 seconds
You:   bookmark the URL — it persists across restarts
```

## [v0.58.0] - 2026-03-15

**Active tab context — OpenClaw now knows what you're looking at**

Added `GET /active-tab/context` — a single endpoint that gives OpenClaw everything it needs to understand what the user is currently viewing, without multiple round-trips.

Response includes:
- active tab id, URL, title, loading state
- viewport dimensions and scroll position
- first 1500 characters of page text (enough to answer questions without a full `/page-content` call)
- full tab list with active flag

Also documented the existing `GET /events/stream` SSE endpoint and `tab-focused` events in the skill file, so agents can subscribe to tab switches without polling. Updated `skill/SKILL.md` with a dedicated "Page Awareness" section.

## [v0.57.22] - 2026-03-15

**Sidebar login persistence fix**

Sidebar webviews (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, Gmail, etc.) were losing their login state every time the panel was switched or the sidebar setup panel was opened. Root cause: Electron destroys and recreates a `<webview>` session when the element is removed from the DOM.

Fix: moved all sidebar webviews into a persistent `#sidebar-webview-host` container that is never wiped. Panel switches now show/hide webviews without touching the DOM. Login state is preserved for the lifetime of the Tandem session.

## [v0.57.21] - 2026-03-15

**Security model refinement — daily browsing fixed, real threats still caught**

This release addresses a series of false positives in the security stack that made normal browsing impractical, and adds background tab API access for OpenClaw agents.

### Security fixes

- **Script analysis containment removed** — ScriptGuard was triggering containment popups on virtually every news site and SPA because minified/obfuscated JavaScript scored high on threat rules. Script analysis now logs anomalies and reports to the gatekeeper channel, but does not activate containment. Containment still activates on confirmed behavioral signals (crypto miner CPU patterns, sustained WASM activity via BehaviorMonitor).

- **LinkedIn fully unblocked** — Three separate layers were blocking LinkedIn:
  - NetworkShield blocklist contained `ads.linkedin.com` and `snap.licdn.com`, causing the parent domain check to block all of `linkedin.com`
  - Gatekeeper was blocking scripts from `static.licdn.com` due to low trust score on first visit
  - ScriptGuard rule engine was running on trusted CDN domains and triggering containment on LinkedIn's minified JS
  - Fixed by adding an explicit domain allowlist in NetworkShield, a trusted script domain list in Guardian, and skipping the rule engine for known CDN domains in ScriptGuard

### API improvements

- **`X-Tab-Id` header support** — `GET /page-content`, `GET /page-html`, and `GET /snapshot` now accept an `X-Tab-Id` request header to target a specific background tab without changing focus. Background tab content extraction uses DevTools `Runtime.evaluate` instead of `executeJavaScript` to avoid hangs on non-active tabs.

### UX fixes

- **Sidebar links now open in new tab** — Links clicked inside sidebar webviews (Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.) were silently denied. They now open in a new Tandem tab as expected.

### Docs

- Added hero screenshot and browser interaction screenshot to README
- Security model description moved to top of README per maintainer feedback
- TODO: expose `POST /screenshot/application` and `POST /screenshot/region` as HTTP API endpoints

## [v0.57.13] - 2026-03-14

- fix: address remaining CodeQL alerts (security)

## [v0.57.12] - 2026-03-14

- fix: harden remaining CodeQL alert clusters (security)

## [v0.57.11] - 2026-03-14

- fix: harden extension and task-manager boundaries (security)

What was built/changed:
- Added shared validation helpers for extension IDs, native messaging host names, and absolute path containment inside trusted roots
- Hardened CRX downloader, extension loader, and native-messaging proxy against path traversal through extension IDs, extension paths, host manifest names, and manifest patch paths
- Hardened TaskManager autonomy updates against prototype-polluting payloads and validated task IDs/step indexes before file or array writes
- Added focused tests for the new extension path validation and task-manager pollution guards

Why this approach:
- These findings are still high-signal because the inputs cross trust boundaries into filesystem paths and mutable object/array writes
- Fixing at the shared boundary points covers all current callers without broad rewrites or new dependencies

Tested:
- npm run verify: passed
- npx vitest run src/agents/tests/task-manager.test.ts src/extensions/tests/extensions.test.ts src/utils/tests/security.test.ts: passed

## [v0.57.10] - 2026-03-14

- fix: reduce first CodeQL security backlog (security)

What was built/changed:
- Added shared security helpers for HTML escaping, URL parsing/matching, root-contained path resolution, and lightweight route rate limiting
- Fixed the flagged bearer-token ReDoS, new-tab DOM XSS, and Google Photos OAuth callback reflected XSS/exception HTML sink
- Replaced substring-based URL trust checks in main-process auth/search heuristics with URL/hostname parsing
- Added root-containment path validation for sessions, workflow templates, Chrome import, site/form memory, and extension update paths
- Added targeted rate limits to the currently flagged sensitive or high-cost API routes plus a global authenticated API ceiling
- Added focused utility tests for the new security helpers

Why this approach:
- Prioritizes exploitable sinks and high-signal trust-boundary flaws before broader CodeQL noise
- Uses structural validation (URL objects, textContent/escaping, root containment) instead of substring checks or superficial filters
- Avoids new dependencies and keeps behavior changes narrow to the flagged risk surfaces

Tested:
- npm run verify: passed
- npx vitest run src/utils/tests/security.test.ts src/utils/tests/utils.test.ts: passed

## [v0.57.9] - 2026-03-14

- fix: split evaluate request destructuring

## [v0.57.8] - 2026-03-14

- fix: auto-wrap window.location navigation in /devtools/evaluate

Prevents renderer blocking when navigating via evaluate endpoint.
Previously, window.location assignments destroyed the JS context
before evaluate could return, causing 30s timeouts and 'not
responding' dialogs.

Now auto-detects window.location assignments and wraps them in
setTimeout(0) to return immediately while navigation happens
asynchronously.

## [v0.57.7] - 2026-03-14

- fix: auto-wrap window.location navigation in /devtools/evaluate to prevent renderer blocking

When evaluating `window.location.href = "..."` via the `/devtools/evaluate` endpoint,
the page navigation destroys the JavaScript context before the evaluate call can return,
causing 30-second timeouts and "application not responding" dialogs. Now automatically
wraps such expressions in `setTimeout(() => {...}, 0)` to allow immediate return while
navigation happens asynchronously in the background.

## [v0.57.6] - 2026-03-14

- fix: tolerate missing recording audio source

## [v0.57.5] - 2026-03-14

- fix: prepare public developer preview (repo)

## [Unreleased]

- fix: reduce the first public CodeQL security backlog

Hardens the highest-signal CodeQL findings first: bearer token parsing no longer
uses the flagged backtracking regex, the new-tab and Google Photos callback
surfaces stop routing untrusted data through HTML sinks, Google/auth/search URL
checks now parse URLs structurally instead of relying on substring tests, and the
first path-traversal cluster now resolves file paths inside trusted roots for
sessions, workflow templates, Chrome import, site/form memory, and extension
updates. Adds a small in-memory API rate limiter for the currently flagged
high-cost and high-sensitivity routes.

- fix: make application screenshot capture fall back cleanly when macOS window capture metadata is unavailable
- fix: tolerate missing screen audio source lookup during application recording setup
- docs: align public-facing repo docs for developer preview and first-party OpenClaw positioning

## [v0.57.4] - 2026-03-09

- fix: use screen source for system audio capture

Window sources don't include audio on macOS. Now fetches both a window
source (for video) and a screen source (for audio) from desktopCapturer.
The screen source captures all system audio via ScreenCaptureKit.

## [v0.57.3] - 2026-03-09

- fix: force 30fps output in ffmpeg conversion

MediaRecorder WebM has variable timestamps that ffmpeg misinterprets
as 1000fps, making the MP4 unplayable in QuickTime. Adding -r 30
forces correct framerate.

## [v0.57.2] - 2026-03-09

- fix: check Screen Recording permission before capture on macOS

Prevents renderer crash by checking systemPreferences.getMediaAccessStatus
before attempting desktopCapturer. Shows user-friendly alert with
instructions to enable permission in System Settings.

## [v0.57.1] - 2026-03-09

- fix: Linux video recorder Wayland/Pipewire compatibility

What was built/changed:
- Use native getDisplayMedia() on Linux instead of desktopCapturer to avoid Wayland screencast portal conflicts
- Add try/catch error handling in get-desktop-source IPC handler to prevent renderer crashes
- Fix stop button event bubbling (stopPropagation) to prevent double-click triggering fullscreen
- Add debug logging for audio track detection
- Platform-aware audio handling (Linux uses getDisplayMedia audio, macOS/Windows use desktopCapturer)

Why this approach:
- Electron's desktopCapturer API has known issues with Wayland/Pipewire portals
- Native getDisplayMedia() is the web standard and works reliably on Wayland
- Prevents renderer crashes from unhandled IPC errors

Tested:
- Video recording on Linux/Wayland: works (video + mic audio)
- Stop button: works (single click + Esc shortcut)
- ffmpeg MP4 conversion: works
- Known limitation: Tab/webview audio not captured on Linux due to Electron process isolation (documented in TODO.md)

## [v0.57.0] - 2026-03-09

- feat: built-in video recorder with Application and Region modes

Replaces AudioCaptureManager with VideoRecorderManager. Uses
desktopCapturer + MediaRecorder → WebM → ffmpeg → MP4 pipeline.

## [v0.56.0] - 2026-03-09

- feat: implement renderer-side video recorder with region crop and audio

## [v0.55.0] - 2026-03-09

- feat: add Record Application/Region to screenshot menu and recording IPC handlers

## [v0.54.0] - 2026-03-09

- feat: add recording overlay bar HTML and CSS

## [v0.53.0] - 2026-03-09

- feat: expose recording APIs in preload bridge

## [v0.52.0] - 2026-03-09

- feat: add VideoRecorderManager, remove AudioCaptureManager

## [v0.51.3] - 2026-03-08

- fix: spell-check tab-snoozing section in opera research doc

Fix typos: "hart" → "heart", "or" → "of", "if" → "as",
"then" → "than", and garbled sentence about sleeping mode.

## [v0.51.2] - 2026-03-08

- fix: correct region overlay bleed and application screenshot color profile

Region mode: wait two animation frames after hiding the selection overlay
before capturing, so the red tint no longer leaks into the saved image.

Application mode: use macOS native screencapture instead of Electron's
capturePage().toPNG(), which didn't embed the Display P3 color profile,
causing color shifts in saved files and Apple Photos.

## [v0.51.1] - 2026-03-08

- fix: use native screenshot mode menu in shell

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: src/preload.ts, src/ipc/handlers.ts, shell/js/wingman.js, shell/index.html, shell/css/browser-shell.css, CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md
- Replaced the renderer-side screenshot mode popup with a native Electron menu triggered from the toolbar camera button
- Removed dead screenshot popup markup and styles from the shell

Why this approach:
- The native menu is more reliable than the custom renderer popup and avoids a second fragile overlay path for a core capture workflow

Tested:
- npx tsc: zero errors
- npx vitest run src/draw/tests/overlay.test.ts: all tests pass
- npm run verify: passed
- Manual: app launch reached Electron startup logs; user restart still required to load the new preload/renderer code

## [v0.51.0] - 2026-03-08

- feat: expand screenshot workflows with google photos and capture modes
- fix: use native screenshot mode menu in shell

## [v0.50.0] - 2026-03-08

## [v0.45.2] - 2026-03-08

- fix: remove tandem extension header helper dependency in 1password patches

## [v0.45.1] - 2026-03-08

- fix: english consistency cleanup pass 2 (ui-copy)

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: CHANGELOG.md, shell/*.html, shell/js/main.js, shell/js/shortcuts.js, shell/css/main.css, src/api/routes/browser.ts, src/api/routes/sessions.ts, src/api/routes/sidebar.ts, src/api/tests/routes/browser.test.ts, src/bridge/context-bridge.ts, src/config/manager.ts, src/downloads/manager.ts, src/headless/manager.ts, src/mcp/server.ts, src/sidebar/manager.ts, src/watch/watcher.ts
- Translated remaining first-party Dutch UI strings, placeholders, alerts, comments, bookmark manager copy, ClaroNote states, and related test expectations
- Left compatibility-sensitive identifiers and locale/config values unchanged where translation would risk regressions

Why this approach:
- Limits the pass to textual consistency changes and avoids renaming routes, persisted keys, IPC surfaces, CSS/DOM identifiers, or browser-fingerprint settings

Tested:
- npm run compile: passed
- npx vitest run: fails with pre-existing unrelated failures in src/tabs/tests/tabs.test.ts, src/extensions/tests/action-polyfill.test.ts, src/api/tests/routes/agents.test.ts, src/api/tests/routes/browser.test.ts (unrelated GET /links case), and src/api/tests/routes/security.test.ts

## [v0.45.0] - 2026-03-08

- feat: add session fetch relay and security containment design

Add POST /sessions/fetch endpoint for same-origin API calls via tab context,
with auth header safety rails, timeout handling, and full test coverage.
Include security containment review design doc.

- fix: repository-wide English consistency cleanup pass 2

Translate remaining first-party Dutch text outside Markdown in shell UI copy,
placeholders, comments, notifications, and related test expectations. Keep
compatibility-sensitive identifiers, locale codes, and persisted/config
surfaces unchanged where translation would be risky.

## [v0.44.88] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Session fetch relay** (`src/api/routes/sessions.ts`) — added `POST /sessions/fetch` so the local API can execute same-origin requests inside the selected tab context, reuse the browser session for authenticated SPA/API calls, and return the response payload without exposing auth headers or tokens
- **Route coverage** (`src/api/tests/routes/sessions.test.ts`, `src/api/tests/helpers.ts`) — added focused tests for successful tab-context fetches, `tabId` selection, JSON body serialization, timeout handling, and the new header/origin safety rails

### Technical Details
- `function registerSessionRoutes()` now validates request method, blocks direct auth/cookie/sec/proxy header injection, resolves relative URLs against the active tab URL, and rejects cross-origin targets before executing page-context `fetch()`
- The relay runs through `webContents.executeJavaScript()` with a 15-second abort timeout, preserves page cookies and any app-level `window.fetch` wrappers already present in the tab, and normalizes JSON responses plus response headers into a stable API envelope
- Verification: `npm run compile` passed; `npx vitest run src/api/tests/routes/sessions.test.ts` passed; `npm start` and manual curl validation were not run in this session

## [v0.44.87] - 2026-03-07

### Changed
- **Curated security feed expansion** (`src/security/blocklists/updater.ts`, `src/security/types.ts`) — expanded the browser-core blocklist manifest with OpenPhish plus high-confidence ThreatFox domain and URL feeds, added explicit source signal/scope metadata, and kept new sources limited to phishing and malware intelligence instead or ad/tracker mega-lists
- **Structured feed filtering** (`src/security/blocklists/updater.ts`) — taught the shared CSV/JSON parser layer to filter records by typed field criteria and to recognize comment-prefixed CSV header rows so mixed IOC exports can stay domain/url-first without feed-specific code paths
- **Phase 4 regression coverage** (`src/security/tests/blocklist-updater.test.ts`) — added focused tests for the expanded source cadence folder and ThreatFox CSV filtering behavior

### Technical Details
- `class BlocklistUpdater` now advertises six runtime blocklist sources through the shared manifest: URLhaus, Phishing Database, OpenPhish, ThreatFox domains, ThreatFox URLs, and the existing StevenBlack legacy carryover source
- ThreatFox entries are constrained to high-confidence domain/url IOCs before they ever reach `NetworkShield`, which keeps the current domain-first lookup model intact and leaves CIDR/range blocking out or scope
- Verification: `npm run compile` passed; `npx vitest run src/security/tests/blocklist-updater.test.ts` passed; full `npx vitest run` still reports unrelated pre-existing failures in `src/tabs/tests/tabs.test.ts` and `src/extensions/tests/action-polyfill.test.ts`; `npm start` plus `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8765/security/status` succeeded and returned the expanded source set

## [v0.44.85] - 2026-03-07

### Changed
- **Tiered security blocklist scheduler** (`src/security/security-manager.ts`, `src/security/blocklists/updater.ts`, `src/security/security-db.ts`) — replaced the single 24-hour refresh rule with per-source hourly/daily/weekly cadence, persisted freshness and failure metadata per feed, and prevented overlapping scheduled refresh runs
- **Security freshness visibility** (`src/security/routes.ts`, `src/security/db-blocklist.ts`) — exposed per-source blocklist freshness through `/security/status` and `/security/blocklist/stats`, and aligned database `lastUpdate` reporting with persisted refresh metadata instead or the request timestamp
- **Phase 3 regression coverage** (`src/security/tests/blocklist-updater.test.ts`, `src/api/tests/routes/security.test.ts`) — added focused tests for due-source selection, per-source failure isolation, and freshness/status responses

### Technical Details
- `class BlocklistUpdater` now owns source cadence checks, updates only due feeds during scheduled runs, records `lastUpdated` / `lastAttempted` / failure state per source, and reloads `NetworkShield` only after at least one successful source refresh
- `class SecurityManager` now schedules hourly freshness checks while serializing queued refresh runs so stale-source checks cannot overlap into concurrent downloads
- Verification: `npm run compile` passed; `npx vitest run src/security/tests/blocklist-updater.test.ts src/api/tests/routes/security.test.ts` passed; full `npx vitest run` still reports unrelated pre-existing failures in `src/tabs/tests/tabs.test.ts` and `src/extensions/tests/action-polyfill.test.ts`; `npm start` plus `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8765/security/status` succeeded and returned per-source freshness data

## [v0.44.83] - 2026-03-07

### Changed
- **Security blocklist fast-start hydration** (`src/security/network-shield.ts`, `src/security/security-manager.ts`) — replaced synchronous startup blocklist parsing with a snapshot-first load path, queued background hydration, and atomic in-memory swaps so Tandem becomes usable before cached feeds finish rebuilding
- **Hydration regression coverage** (`src/security/tests/network-shield-hydration.test.ts`) — added focused coverage for snapshot boot, no-clear reload behavior, cached hydrate promotion, and snapshot persistence refresh

### Technical Details
- `class NetworkShield` now boots from `startup-snapshot.json` when available, keeps DB-backed blocklist checks live during hydration, and rebuilds replacement `Set` instances before swapping them into request checks
- Background hydration yields between cached sources, serializes overlapping reload requests, and persists a last-known-good snapshot plus blocklist metadata only after the replacement state is complete
- Verification: `npm run compile` passed; `npx vitest run src/security/tests/` passed; `npm start` reached API/UI readiness before blocklist hydration completed and later logged an atomic hydrate completion with 794198 domains / 1887 IP origins; full `npx vitest run` still reports unrelated pre-existing failures in `src/tabs/tests/tabs.test.ts` and `src/extensions/tests/action-polyfill.test.ts`

## [v0.44.81] - 2026-03-07

### Changed
- **Security blocklist parser foundation** (`src/security/types.ts`, `src/security/blocklists/updater.ts`, `src/security/network-shield.ts`) — replaced hardcoded per-file parser branches with a shared source manifest and parser layer that supports legacy text feeds plus declarative JSON and CSV sources without changing the current security feed set

### Technical Details
- Added typed blocklist parser/source definitions so the updater and `NetworkShield` can use the same parser contract for hosts, domain lists, URL lists, JSON records, and CSV columns
- Moved cached blocklist loading onto the same `BLOCKLIST_SOURCES` manifest used for downloads, including stable cache filenames for the existing URLhaus, phishing, and Steven Black feeds
- Shared URL-list safe-domain filtering and IP-origin extraction across both update-time parsing and runtime in-memory loading to keep request checks aligned ahead or the fast-start snapshot phase
- Verification: `npm run compile` passed; `npm start` plus `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8765/security/status` succeeded; full `npx vitest run` still reports unrelated pre-existing failures in `src/tabs/tests/tabs.test.ts` and `src/extensions/tests/action-polyfill.test.ts`

## [v0.44.80] - 2026-03-07

### Changed
- **Automatic containment responses** (`src/security/security-manager.ts`, `src/security/guardian.ts`, `src/security/script-guard.ts`, `src/security/behavior-monitor.ts`, `src/main.ts`) — turned critical script and runtime detections into real containment actions that quarantine the affected tab, force strict mode, lower trust, and preserve an incident evidence snapshot for later review
- **Shell-side recovery messaging** (`src/main.ts`) — routed containment incidents through the existing emergency-stop shell path and added a native warning dialog so Robin gets an immediate explanation plus a recovery instruction without exposing any UI inside the page

### Technical Details
- `class Guardian` now supports per-webContents quarantine so contained browsing tabs fail closed on subsequent network activity without widening trust for extension, sidebar, or shell traffic
- `class SecurityManager` now records bounded containment incidents with parsed-script and recent resource evidence, downgrades the affected domain, and exposes the incidents for follow-up review
- `class BehaviorMonitor` can terminate execution for the affected tab when miner-like WASM and CPU behavior trips a critical threshold
- Verification: `npm run compile` passed; full `npx vitest run` still reports unrelated pre-existing failures in `src/tabs/tests/tabs.test.ts` and `src/extensions/tests/action-polyfill.test.ts`

## [v0.44.78] - 2026-03-07

### Changed
- **Extension trust scoping** (`src/extensions/manager.ts`, `src/api/server.ts`, `src/api/routes/extensions.ts`) — added explicit `trusted` / `limited` / `unknown` extension trust levels and route-specific helper scopes so extension-origin callers must present the right permissions for `active-tab`, `webNavigation`, `identity`, and native messaging helpers
- **Native messaging boundary checks** (`src/extensions/native-messaging.ts`, `src/extensions/nm-proxy.ts`, `src/main.ts`) — applied the same trust decision to the native messaging HTTP and WebSocket bridges, validated host manifests against allowed extension IDs plus known runtime/CWS host mappings, and bound bridge audit logs to the calling extension identity
- **Tests** (`src/api/tests/server-auth.test.ts`, `src/extensions/tests/trust.test.ts`, `src/extensions/tests/native-messaging.test.ts`, `src/api/tests/routes/extensions.test.ts`) — added focused coverage for scoped helper auth, bridge identity mismatch rejection, and native messaging host allowlist enforcement

### Technical Details
- Extension-origin helper routes now evaluate a central `ExtensionManager.evaluateApiRouteAccess()` decision instead or relying on a generic "installed extension" allow path
- Tandem records extension helper allow/deny decisions with extension identity, trust level, and route scope in the API/NM proxy logs
- `POST /extensions/identity/auth` now resolves installation status through the same stable extension identity lookup used by the trust model
- Verification: `npm run compile` passed; focused extension/security Vitest coverage passed; `npm start` plus local `curl` checks succeeded; full `npx vitest run` still reports unrelated pre-existing failures in `src/tabs/tests/tabs.test.ts` and `src/extensions/tests/action-polyfill.test.ts`

## [v0.44.76] - 2026-03-07

- fix: isolate tabs per workspace

## [v0.44.75] - 2026-03-07

- fix: restore workspace tab switching

## [v0.44.74] - 2026-03-07

- fix: restore 1password extension helper auth

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: src/api/server.ts, src/extensions/action-polyfill.ts
- Added explicit extension ID propagation for local extension helper routes
- Allowed trusted extension helper auth via origin, referer, or X-Tandem-Extension-Id for installed extensions
- Upgraded existing on-disk 1Password patches so old active-tab/log bridge calls are rewritten on startup

Why this approach:
- Electron does not consistently send Origin for extension background/service-worker fetches to localhost
- 1Password lost its active-tab and frame bridge after API hardening because those helper requests no longer authenticated reliably
- The fix stays scoped to trusted extension helper routes and installed extension IDs

Tested:
- npm run compile: zero errors
- npm start: 1Password helper patch upgrade applied at startup
- Manual: user confirmed autofill flow works again

## [v0.44.73] - 2026-03-07

- fix: remove fs access from sandboxed preload

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: src/preload.ts
- Removed direct fs-based API token reads from the Electron preload
- Kept the preload bridge minimal and Electron-safe under sandbox mode

Why this approach:
- The preload was crashing on startup with 'module not found: fs'
- That removed window.tandem entirely, which broke tabs, sidebar rendering, and internal shell controls
- Local API auth now lives in the main-process session hook and token IPC, not in the preload filesystem path

Tested:
- npm run compile: zero errors
- npm start: preload no longer fails to load, shell starts without the preload fs crash

## [v0.44.72] - 2026-03-07

- fix: normalize shell API auth header override

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: src/main.ts
- Normalized Authorization headers before injecting the shell bearer token for local file:// requests

Why this approach:
- Chromium can carry both authorization and Authorization header keys during request rewriting
- Removing all casing variants before setting the bearer token ensures the shell auth hook actually wins

Tested:
- npm run compile: zero errors
- npm start: shell unauthorized requests for /sidebar/config, /workspaces, and /bookmarks no longer reproduced locally

## [v0.44.71] - 2026-03-07

- fix: restore shell API auth in session layer

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: src/main.ts
- Added a RequestDispatcher header hook for internal shell requests to the local Tandem API
- Kept API hardening intact for non-shell callers

Why this approach:
- Renderer-side token bootstrapping was still fragile across shell pages and internal webviews
- Injecting the bearer token in Electron's request layer fixes shell/index.html and file:// webviews without re-trusting localhost broadly

Tested:
- npm run compile: zero errors

## [v0.44.70] - 2026-03-07

- fix: bootstrap shell auth across internal pages

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: src/main.ts, shell/index.html, shell/newtab.html, shell/settings.html, shell/bookmarks.html
- New file: shell/js/api-auth.js
- Registered the get-api-token IPC handler before the shell window loads so the first authenticated shell requests do not race startup
- Added a shared shell auth bootstrap that wraps local Tandem API fetch calls and retries token acquisition during early startup
- Enabled the same auth bootstrap on shell subpages such as newtab, settings, and bookmarks

Why this approach:
- Internal shell pages were still failing closed because they either ran before the token IPC bridge was ready or were never using the shell auth wrapper at all; this makes the internal caller path explicit and consistent without reopening broad loopback trust

Tested:
- npm run compile: zero errors
- Manual runtime verification still requires restarting the already-running Tandem app

## [v0.44.69] - 2026-03-07

- fix: fetch shell API token via IPC

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: src/ipc/handlers.ts, src/preload.ts, shell/index.html
- Added an IPC handler for reading the local API token from the main process
- Switched the preload getApiToken bridge to use ipcRenderer.invoke instead or relying on preload-side file access
- Updated the shell bootstrap fetch wrapper to lazily await and cache the token before authenticating local Tandem API requests

Why this approach:
- The shell page still emitted unauthenticated requests because token retrieval in the sandboxed renderer path was not reliable; fetching the token from the main process makes the page-world auth wrapper deterministic

Tested:
- npm run compile: zero errors
- Manual runtime still requires restarting the already-running Tandem app to load the new preload and shell bootstrap

## [v0.44.68] - 2026-03-07

- fix: restore shell and extension API auth

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: shell/index.html, src/preload.ts, src/api/server.ts
- Added a shell bootstrap that patches page-world fetch for local Tandem API calls using the preload-exposed bearer token
- Exposed getApiToken() from preload so shell scripts can recover the local API token consistently
- Broadened trusted extension ID matching so runtime IDs and on-disk extension IDs both satisfy the Phase 1 extension auth checks

Why this approach:
- The earlier preload-only fetch patch ran in the isolated preload world, but the shell page was still issuing unauthenticated requests from the page world; this fix authenticates the actual caller while preserving the hardened API boundary

Tested:
- npm run compile: zero errors
- Manual runtime verification still requires restarting the already-running Tandem app to load the updated preload and shell bootstrap

## [v0.44.67] - 2026-03-07

- fix: restore shell auth for local API calls

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: src/preload.ts
- Exposed the local API token to the shell and wrapped shell-side fetch so requests to the Tandem API automatically include Authorization: Bearer unless an explicit auth header is already present

Why this approach:
- Keeps the Phase 1 API hardening intact while restoring authenticated shell access for sidebar, chat polling, and other local UI calls that were previously relying on implicit loopback trust

Tested:
- npm run compile: zero errors
- Manual runtime still requires restarting the already-running Tandem app so the updated preload script is loaded

## [v0.44.66] - 2026-03-07

- fix: strengthen outbound containment policy (security-hardening)

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: src/security/guardian.ts, src/security/outbound-guard.ts, src/security/types.ts, src/security/tests/gatekeeper-enforcement.test.ts, src/security/tests/outbound-containment.test.ts, package.json, CHANGELOG.md
- Added richer outbound decision metadata so Guardian logs explain why mutating requests and WebSocket upgrades were allowed, flagged, held, or blocked
- Tightened mode-sensitive containment for unknown WebSocket endpoints, first-visit mutating destinations, and trusted-to-untrusted cross-origin transitions, while exempting same-site cross-subdomain traffic to keep balanced mode usable
- Added focused tests for the new outbound containment policies and Guardian enforcement path

Why this approach:
- Keeps Phase 4 scoped to the outbound decision layer while using the existing Gatekeeper hold/block path for higher-risk cases instead or inventing a separate enforcement mechanism

Tested:
- npm run compile: zero errors
- npx vitest run src/security/tests/outbound-containment.test.ts src/security/tests/gatekeeper-enforcement.test.ts: all 11 tests pass
- npx vitest run: still fails on unrelated pre-existing suites in src/extensions/tests/action-polyfill.test.ts and src/tabs/tests/tabs.test.ts
- Manual: npm start succeeded, initialized the security stack and API on 127.0.0.1:8765, and curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/status returned ready state

## [v0.44.65] - 2026-03-07

- fix: expand per-tab runtime security coverage (security-hardening)

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: src/devtools/manager.ts, src/ipc/handlers.ts, src/main.ts, src/security/behavior-monitor.ts, src/security/script-guard.ts, src/security/security-manager.ts, package.json, CHANGELOG.md
- Added multi-tab CDP attachment state in DevToolsManager so security code can target specific webContents without stealing the primary active-tab session
- Moved ScriptGuard and BehaviorMonitor runtime state to per-tab maps and added explicit tab created/navigated/closed lifecycle handling in SecurityManager and main process wiring

Why this approach:
- Expands security coverage to live background/restored tabs while preserving the existing active-tab CDP APIs used by the rest or the browser

Tested:
- npm run compile: zero errors
- npx vitest run: fails on pre-existing unrelated suites in src/extensions/tests/action-polyfill.test.ts and src/tabs/tests/tabs.test.ts
- Manual: npm start succeeded and initialized the security stack plus API on 127.0.0.1:8765

## [v0.44.63] - 2026-03-07

- fix: enforce gatekeeper decisions for risky requests (security-hardening)

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: src/network/dispatcher.ts, src/security/guardian.ts, src/security/gatekeeper-ws.ts, src/security/types.ts, src/security/tests/gatekeeper-enforcement.test.ts
- Gatekeeper enforcement: async `onBeforeRequest` support in `RequestDispatcher`, explicit Gatekeeper decision classes, request holds for risky first-visit navigations, deny-on-timeout handling for strict low-trust scripts and suspicious downloads, and explicit fallback behavior when Gatekeeper is disconnected or saturated
- Logging/tests: Gatekeeper queue and resolution logs now record hold/allow/block/timeout states, and focused tests cover async request holds plus timeout policy behavior

Why this approach:
- Keeps balanced browsing usable by limiting request holds to selected risky cases while making stricter paths fail closed instead or silently defaulting to allow

Tested:
- npm run compile: zero errors
- npx vitest run src/security/tests/gatekeeper-enforcement.test.ts: all 4 tests pass
- npx vitest run: still fails on unrelated pre-existing suites in src/extensions/tests/action-polyfill.test.ts and src/tabs/tests/tabs.test.ts
- Manual: npm run dev started successfully, initialized the security stack and API on 127.0.0.1:8765
- Curl: GET /status returned ready state from the running app

## [v0.44.62] - 2026-03-07

- fix: tighten local API auth boundary (security-hardening)

What was built/changed:
- Modified files: src/api/server.ts, src/api/routes/extensions.ts, src/extensions/nm-proxy.ts, src/main.ts, package.json, CHANGELOG.md, docs/implementations/security-hardening/LEES-MIJ-EERST.md
- New API behavior: bearer auth required for normal HTTP routes, explicit trusted-extension allowlist for extension helper routes, query-string token auth removed, native-messaging WS upgrade now validates installed extension origins

Why this approach:
- Replaces blanket loopback trust with an explicit caller model while keeping only the minimum extension-specific bridges outside bearer auth

Tested:
- npm run compile: zero errors
- npx vitest run: fails on pre-existing unrelated suites in src/extensions/tests/action-polyfill.test.ts and src/tabs/tests/tabs.test.ts
- Manual: npm run dev attempted, but a user-run Tandem process already held 127.0.0.1:8765
- Curl: isolated TandemAPI on 127.0.0.1:8876 returned 401 for unauthenticated /tabs/list, 200 with bearer token, 401 for query-token auth, and 401 for /extensions/active-tab without a trusted extension origin

## [v0.44.60] - 2026-03-07

- docs(workflow): add reusable multi-phase execution templates

Added generic templates for self-tracking multi-phase implementation tracks and
for universal session prompts, so the same workflow used for security hardening
can be reused for future larger feature or hardening efforts.

Updated `AGENTS.md` to explicitly point maintainers and coding sessions to this
template pattern whenever work spans multiple sessions.

## [v0.44.59] - 2026-03-07

- docs(security): add self-tracking phase log and universal session prompt

Updated the security hardening handoff guide so each future session can detect
the next unfinished phase automatically, record its own completion state, and
leave a structured handoff for the next session.

Also added a reusable universal session prompt document for the security
hardening track so new sessions can be started with the same scoped workflow
without manually naming the phase each time.

## [v0.44.58] - 2026-03-07

- docs(security): add phased security hardening roadmap

Added a dedicated security hardening planning track with one master design
document plus six implementation phase documents covering API auth, Gatekeeper
enforcement, per-tab monitoring, outbound containment, extension trust, and
automatic containment actions.

The goal or the new docs set is to let future sessions execute the security work
in bounded steps without relying on chat context or losing sight or the overall
hardening objective.

## [v0.44.57] - 2026-03-07

- docs(repo): translate AGENTS guide to English

Translated the internal `AGENTS.md` workflow guide into English while keeping
the same project rules, anti-detection constraints, development workflow, and
reporting expectations. This keeps the maintainer instructions consistent with
the rest or the repository-facing documentation cleanup.

## [v0.44.56] - 2026-03-07

- docs(repo): clarify OpenClaw positioning and classify maintainer workflow docs

Updated the top-level project docs to position Tandem more clearly as the
browser environment built for OpenClaw, while keeping Wingman as the user-facing
name for the right-side collaboration panel and documenting Kees as the default
OpenClaw persona.

Cleaned up several `docs/` entry points so contributor workflow files such as
`CLAUDE.md` and historical `LEES-MIJ-EERST.md` packs are clearly treated as
maintainer artifacts rather than the primary public documentation surface. Also
modernized electron-builder output naming with an explicit
`tandem-browser-${version}-${arch}.${ext}` artifact pattern and macOS package
targets.

## [v0.44.55] - 2026-03-07

- docs(repo): add GitHub community files and separate internal planning docs

Added GitHub issue templates and `CODEOWNERS`, introduced `docs/README.md` plus
`docs/internal/README.md`, and moved the top-level roadmap/status planning files
under `docs/internal/` to keep the public docs surface cleaner.

Updated the README with a clearer UI summary including the left sidebar
capabilities, removed personal contact data from package metadata and setup
scripts, and revised the security reporting doc away from direct personal email.

## [v0.44.54] - 2026-03-07

- docs(repo): add public-facing repo docs and improve release metadata

Rewrote the README around public-facing positioning and onboarding, added
standard top-level `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `SECURITY.md` files, and
marked the remaining root internal workflow documents as internal-only.

Updated `package.json` metadata with repository, homepage, issue tracker,
keywords, and platform build categories so the repo and release configuration
look more complete ahead or a future public release.

## [v0.44.53] - 2026-03-07

- chore(repo): remove local artifacts and stale release metadata

Removed tracked local Playwright console logs, ad-hoc root-level scratch test
files, and an unused screenshot asset from the repository root so the workspace
is cleaner for future public release preparation.

Updated top-level documentation to stop hardcoding stale version numbers and
aligned release-facing references to point at `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`
instead. Also refreshed the architecture overview in `PROJECT.md` to reference
Electron 40.

## [v0.44.52] - 2026-03-07

- fix(extensions): add storage.session + notification state shims for 1Password

Extended the 1Password action polyfill with a `chrome.storage.session` shim in
the service worker, including `get`, `set`, `remove`, `clear`, and
`storage.onChanged` support. This gives the extension an ephemeral runtime store
for policy calculation and other short-lived state that Electron does not expose
reliably in this context.

Upgraded the notification stub from a pure no-op to an in-memory implementation
that tracks created notifications and allows `update()` / `clear()` calls to
succeed. This removes a class or `replaceNotification: messenger-error` failures
when 1Password updates passkey and inline notification state.

## [v0.44.51] - 2026-03-07

- fix(extensions): retry 1Password USO tab messages without frame targeting

Adjusted `/extensions/web-navigation/frames` so the top-level frame is exposed as
Chrome-style `frameId: 0` instead or Electron's raw routing id. This makes the
frame tree look like a normal Chrome tab to extensions that reason about the
main frame separately from subframes.

Updated the extension action polyfill to intercept `chrome.tabs.sendMessage()`
and strip unsupported `documentId` targeting. For 1Password's `uso-*` messages,
the polyfill now retries once without `frameId` / `documentId` when Electron
rejects the targeted delivery, so inline autofill UI can still talk to the
top-frame content script on normal login forms.

## [v0.44.50] - 2026-03-07

- fix(extensions): bridge webNavigation frame data for 1Password autofill

Added `/extensions/web-navigation/frames` and `/extensions/web-navigation/frame`
so extension service workers can query the real frame tree or the active webview
via Electron `WebFrameMain` data instead or getting an empty `webNavigation`
stub.

Updated the 1Password action polyfill to route `chrome.webNavigation.getAllFrames()`
and `getFrame()` through those endpoints, which should let the extension detect
sign-in frames and target the correct input fields for autofill.

## [v0.44.49] - 2026-03-07

- chore(about): simplify About page — remove Dutch quote and Wingman subtitle, update tagline to "Built for your AI. Security included.", remove team credits line

## [v0.44.48] - 2026-03-06

- fix(extensions): add 1password7 NM host + migrate to session.extensions.loadExtension

Added `com.1password.1password7` as a supported alias for the existing
1Password native messaging host so the NM proxy now resolves both host
names to the same native helper binary and no longer treats the `...7`
variant as missing.

Migrated extension loading from deprecated `session.loadExtension()` to
`session.extensions.loadExtension()` in the extension loader and session
loading paths, and updated the related inline documentation to match the
Electron 40 API.

## [v0.44.47] - 2026-03-06

- fix(lifecycle): teardown managers and IPC listeners on window close

Added a central teardown path in `src/main.ts` that destroys all live
managers, stops the API, clears the cookie flush interval, removes the
`tab-register` IPC listener, and resets retained startup state when the
main window closes or the app reactivates on macOS.

`src/ipc/handlers.ts` now removes every IPC channel and handler it
re-registers, including window controls and `is-window-maximized`, so
reactivation no longer stacks stale handlers bound to destroyed windows.

Guarded renderer sends for TaskManager event forwarding in `src/main.ts`
and all renderer sends in `src/voice/recognition.ts`, preventing
`Object has been destroyed` crashes during shutdown and reactivation.

## [v0.44.46] - 2026-03-06

- feat(tabs): shrink tabs dynamically when many are open, like Chrome

Tab items now use `flex: 1` with `min-width: 28px` (was fixed 120px),
so the tab strip compresses automatically as more tabs are added.
Tab titles truncate with ellipsis at narrow widths; the favicon remains
visible at all sizes.

## [v0.44.45] - 2026-03-06

- fix(stability): guard win.webContents calls with isDestroyed() checks

All `win.webContents.send()` calls in `panel/manager.ts` are now guarded
with `isDestroyed()` checks, preventing 'TypeError: Object has been
destroyed' crashes when the panel window closes while IPC events are
still firing. Added early isDestroyed() check in `tabs/manager.ts`
`openTab()`. Also fixed `POST /execute-js` to respect the `tabId`
parameter instead or always targeting the active webcontents.

## [v0.44.44] - 2026-03-06

- fix(autofill): patch Kfj() and zj.getShortcuts() via action-polyfill

Two 1Password autofill errors eliminated:
- `Kfj()` called `browser.windows.getCurrent()` which is undefined in
  Electron's Service Worker context, causing `getItemDetails()` to throw.
  Patched to always return `false` (Tandem never opens 1Password in a
  detached popup window).
- `zj.getShortcuts()` called `browser.commands.getAll()` which throws when
  `browser.commands` is undefined in Electron. Guarded with early return
  `{browserAction:"",lock:""}` when `browser.commands` is absent.
Both patches are now applied via the `action-polyfill.ts` patch pipeline
(not by direct edits to background.js) so they survive extension reloads.

## [v0.44.4] - 2026-03-04

- fix: correct newtab.html path in ipc handlers

handlers.js compiles to dist/ipc/, so __dirname is dist/ipc/.
The previous path.join(__dirname, '..', 'shell', 'newtab.html')
resolved to dist/shell/newtab.html which does not exist.

Adding an extra '..' resolves to the correct shell/newtab.html
at the project root, matching the path calculation used in main.ts.

## [v0.44.3] - 2026-03-04

- fix: prevent zombie tabs from renderer/main-process state drift

Root cause: when openTab() fails after createTab() has already added the
webview and tabEl to the renderer's DOM and tabs Folder, the main process
never registers the tab. Subsequent closeTab() calls return early (tab
not in main-process Folder), leaving an uncloseable orphan in the tab strip.

A secondary cause: if the removeTab() IPC call throws during a normal
closeTab(), the main-process tab entry was never deleted, leaving the tab
stuck open from the main-process side.

Changes:
- shell/js/main.js: add 15s timeout to createTab() dom-ready Promise;
  on timeout, clean up webview/tabEl/tabs Folder entry before rejecting.
  Expose getTabIds() and cleanupOrphan() on window.__tandemTabs for
  reconciliation from the main process.
- src/tabs/manager.ts: catch createTab() failures in openTab() and call
  cleanupOrphan() in the renderer before rethrowing, preventing partial
  renderer state from persisting.
  Make removeTab() IPC call in closeTab() best-effort: log the error but
  always delete from this.tabs so the tab cannot become permanently
  uncloseable due to a renderer IPC failure.
  Add reconcileWithRenderer(): queries renderer tab IDs, removes any
  orphans (renderer knows tab, main process does not) via cleanupOrphan().
- src/ipc/handlers.ts: in tab-close IPC handler, only emit tab-closed
  events when the tab was actually tracked. If closeTab() returns false,
  run reconcileWithRenderer() to clean up any renderer orphan.
- src/api/routes/tabs.ts: add POST /tabs/reconcile endpoint for on-demand
  reconciliation via the API.
- src/main.ts: after restoreSessionTabs() completes, run
  reconcileWithRenderer() to remove any orphans left by failed restores.

Tests: 36 new test cases covering openTab() cleanup on failure,
closeTab() robustness against IPC errors, and reconcileWithRenderer()
behaviour (orphan removal, sync state, getTabIds() failure handling).
All 947 tests pass.

## [v0.44.2] - 2026-03-02

- fix: ACTUALLY use sidebar panel for About (was still using BrowserWindow!)

The hamburger menu was still creating a BrowserWindow for About
instead or opening the sidebar panel. Now it properly sends
'show-about' event which triggers renderAboutPanel().

THIS time it's really fixed. Sorry for the confusion!

## [v0.44.1] - 2026-03-02

- fix: About only via hamburger menu, no sidebar icon

Changes:
- Removed 'about' from sidebar config (no icon shown)
- Hamburger menu → About Tandem Browser now calls renderAboutPanel() directly
- Opens sidebar panel with frosted glass effect
- No separate icon in sidebar needed

About is now ONLY accessible via ☰ → Tandem → About Tandem Browser

## [v0.44.0] - 2026-03-02

- feat: About as SIDEBAR PANEL with real frosted glass!

Finally! About now opens in the sidebar panel like
Bookmarks/History/etc instead or as center overlay.

Changes:
- Added 'about' item to sidebar config (order 19)
- Added info-circle icon for About
- renderAboutPanel() function renders content in sidebar-panel-content
- activateItem('about') triggers panel open
- Same frosted glass effect as ALL sidebar panels
- Removed center overlay code completely

Now backdrop-filter WORKS because About is part or main window!

## [v0.43.1] - 2026-03-02

- fix: use EXACT onboarding overlay pattern for About

Copied exact structure from onboarding overlay instead or
inventing my own:

- .about-overlay with .visible class toggle
- background: var(--surface) with backdrop-filter: blur(20px)
- Same CSS variables and styling
- Click outside to close

Now matches existing overlay pattern in codebase!

## [v0.43.0] - 2026-03-02

- feat: About as overlay with true frosted glass effect

Changed About from separate BrowserWindow to in-window overlay,
matching bookmarks panel style:

- Overlay div in main window (not separate BrowserWindow)
- backdrop-filter now blurs actual page content behind it
- Same visual effect as bookmarks/history panels
- Click outside or X button to close
- GitHub link opens new tab in Tandem

True frosted glass effect finally achieved!

## [v0.42.0] - 2026-03-02

- feat: frosted glass effect for About window

Applied same styling as sidebar panels:
- backdrop-filter: blur(32px) + saturate + brightness
- Semi-transparent dark background
- Subtle border and shadow
- Transparent BrowserWindow for backdrop effect

Matches the beautiful glass effect from bookmarks panel

## [v0.41.9] - 2026-03-02

- fix: remove duplicate onOpenUrlInNewTab listener

Was registering the listener twice, causing 2 tabs to open
instead or 1 when clicking About links

## [v0.41.8] - 2026-03-02

- fix: remove duplicate onOpenUrlInNewTab handler

TypeScript error: object literal cannot have multiple properties
with the same name

## [v0.41.7] - 2026-03-02

- fix: About window links open in new Tandem tab

Instead or opening in system browser (Chrome), links from the
About window now open in a new tab within Tandem.

Added new IPC event 'open-url-in-new-tab' that triggers tab creation.

## [v0.41.6] - 2026-03-02

- fix: remove duplicate BrowserWindow import

BrowserWindow should be imported as value, not type

## [v0.41.5] - 2026-03-02

- fix: prevent crash on hamburger menu click

Issues fixed:
- Remove require() calls in IPC handler (caused hang)
- Use proper imports at top level
- Add 'as const' to role types
- Import shell from electron

The dynamic require() calls were blocking the event loop

## [v0.41.4] - 2026-03-02

- fix: TypeScript error in setWindowOpenHandler

Add explicit type for url parameter

## [v0.41.3] - 2026-03-02

- fix: About window branding and link behavior

Changes:
- Co-Pilot Browser → Wingman Browser
- Remove 'Tandem Repo' link (repo not public yet)
- About window frameless on Linux (no native menubar)
- External links open in system browser, not popup window

Fixes #3 issues reported by user

## [v0.41.2] - 2026-03-02

- fix: use _win instead or win in window control handlers

TypeScript error: variable is destructured as 'win: _win'

## [v0.41.1] - 2026-03-02

- fix: pinboard sync not loading on fresh device

When no local boards.json exists, load() creates an empty store with
lastModified set to now. mergeFromSync() then skips the shared file
because sharedTime < localTime (shared was written in the past).

Fix: if local has zero boards, always prefer the shared version
regardless or timestamp. This ensures new devices pick up existing
pinboards on first launch.

## [v0.41.0] - 2026-03-02

- feat: two-way sync — read shared data from Google Drive on startup

- feat: Pinboards — PinboardManager, REST API, sidebar panel, context menu (v0.32.0)

## [v0.31.0] - 2026-03-01

- feat: SyncManager — cross-device tab/history/workspace sync via shared folder

Add SyncManager that enables cross-device sync by writing device-specific
data (tabs, history) and shared data (workspaces) to a configurable sync
folder (Google Drive, iCloud, or any local path). Includes "Your Devices"
